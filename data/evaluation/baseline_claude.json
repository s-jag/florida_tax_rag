These local surtaxes can range from 0.5% to 2.5%, depending on the county, making the total combined rate range from 6% to 8.5% statewide.\n\nThe 6% state rate has been in effect since January 1, 1990, when it was increased from the previous 5% rate.",

The annual return is due by January 20th of the following year.\n\n**Quarterly Filing Option:**\nPer **Florida Statute \u00a7 212.11(1)(a)**, dealers whose average monthly tax liability is more than $50 but $200 or less may file returns and remit tax on a quarterly basis. Quarterly returns are due by the 20th day of the month following the end of each calendar quarter.\n\n**Monthly Filing (Default):**\nUnder **Florida Statute \u00a7 212.11(1)**, all other dealers must file monthly returns by the 20th day of the following month.\n\n**Administrative Rules:**\n**Florida Administrative Code Rule 12A-1.056** provides additional guidance on filing frequencies and specifies that the Department of Revenue determines filing frequency based on the dealer's average monthly tax liability over the preceding four quarters.\n\n**Key Point:** The classification as a \"small seller\" for annual filing purposes requires that the dealer's average monthly Florida sales tax liability not exceed $50. This average is calculated based on the dealer's tax liability history, and the Department may adjust filing frequency accordingly.\n\nFor the most current filing requirements, dealers should verify their specific filing frequency with the Florida Department of Revenue, as it may change based on their actual tax liability patterns.",

SaaS is not listed among the specifically taxable services.\n\n3. **Remote Access Model**: The software remains on the provider's servers, and customers only receive access rights, which distinguishes it from taxable software sales or licenses.\n\n### Important Exceptions to Consider:\n- If SaaS includes taxable services listed in **\u00a7 212.05(1)** (such as certain communications services), those components may be taxable\n- Bundled transactions that include taxable tangible personal property may have taxable components\n\n### Current Status:\nAs of current Florida law, pure SaaS offerings where customers access software remotely without receiving tangible personal property or specifically enumerated taxable services are not subject to Florida sales tax.\n\n**Note**: Tax laws can change, and specific fact patterns may affect taxability.

The expected citations were not correctly used; the provided statutes (\u00a7 212.05(1)(e) and \u00a7 212.02(16)) do not exist in the context described, indicating hallucinations. The correct statute for addressing the taxability of SaaS or digital products is \u00a7 212.05(1)(i), and the relevant rule is 12A-1.032, which were not accurately cited or discussed. The response fails to cover the nuanced approach Florida takes towards taxing SaaS, particularly overlooking the importance of how the service is accessed and the potential applicability of taxes on communication services.

The explanation is clear, well-organized, and easy to follow, effectively breaking down complex legal concepts into understandable segments. The economic nexus threshold of $100,000 in sales or 200 transactions in Florida is correctly identified, aligning with the key concepts expected. However, there's a minor citation error: the specific statute for economic nexus is cited as \u00a7 212.05(1)(i), which might be a slight misreference or outdated, as the evaluator expected \u00a7 212.0596 without specifying the subsection for economic nexus. This discrepancy in citation does not significantly detract from the factual accuracy but is noted for precision. No hallucinations or invented facts are present, and all key concepts expected are covered. The overall quality of the answer is high, providing a thorough understanding of Florida's sales tax nexus requirements."

The answer correctly cites Florida Statute \u00a7 212.02(16) for the definition of tangible personal property and references the relevant Florida Administrative Code Rule 12A-1.032 to support its analysis. The key exceptions and considerations section is particularly helpful, noting specific scenarios where digital goods might be taxable, such as canned software and digital products delivered on a tangible medium. The mention of streaming services adds value by addressing a common question related to digital goods. The citation accuracy is slightly marked down because the specific subsections of the statutes and rules (e.g., \u00a7 212.05(1)(i) and Rule 12A-1.032(2)) could potentially be verified for precision, but the overall reference to statutes and rules is appropriate and supports the analysis well.

Specifically enumerated in the statute, or\n2. Performed on tangible personal property (with specific exceptions)\n\n**Florida Administrative Code Rule 12A-1.007** addresses mixed transactions involving both goods and services, establishing guidelines for determining taxability when services are bundled with tangible personal property.\n\n## Non-Taxable Services\n\nServices **not specifically enumerated** in Chapter 212 are generally non-taxable. This includes most:\n- Professional services (legal, medical, accounting)\n- Personal services (haircuts, massages)\n- Educational services\n- Financial services\n\n## Key Distinction\n\nThe fundamental principle, established in **Florida Statute \u00a7 212.02(14)**, defines \"retail sale\" and \"sale at retail\" in a way that requires specific statutory authorization for service taxation. Unlike many states that broadly tax services, Florida maintains a narrow, enumerated approach.\n\nThis enumeration method means that Florida businesses and tax practitioners must specifically check whether a service appears in the statutory list rather than applying broad categories or principles to determine taxability.",

However, it inaccurately cites Chapter 212.08(7)(a), F.S., and Chapter 212.05(1)(a), F.S., which are not directly relevant to the taxation of contractors on materials as described in the expected answer. The correct statute, 212.06(14), and the specific rule, 12A-1.051, which directly address the taxation of contractors as end users of materials, were not correctly cited or explained. Despite these inaccuracies and omissions, the answer does provide a general understanding of the subject, but it fails to meet the expected accuracy and completeness regarding the key concepts and citations. The clarity of the explanation is good, making the information accessible, but the citation accuracy significantly detracts from the overall quality of the response."

The price of the taxable products is **de minimis** (10% or less of the total bundled price)\n2. The transaction consists entirely of products taxable at the same rate\n3. The transaction includes exempt food and food ingredients bundled with taxable items where the exempt food represents more than 75% of the bundled price\n\n## Administrative Guidance\n\n**Florida Administrative Code Rule 12A-1.007** provides additional clarification that:\n- Separately stated charges for exempt items can avoid bundled transaction treatment\n- The seller has the burden to prove any claimed exemption\n- Documentation must support the allocation of bundled pricing\n\n## Practical Impact\n\nThis means that when taxable and exempt items are sold together for one price, the entire transaction is generally taxable unless the specific statutory exceptions apply. Retailers can avoid this by separately stating prices for exempt components.\n\nThe bundled transaction rules ensure tax compliance while preventing manipulation of exempt item sales through packaging arrangements.",
